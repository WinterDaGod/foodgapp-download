## 🔑 1. Identity, Security & Onboarding
*   **Password UX**: During registration, type a password. Verify the **Live Strength Checklist** turns green as requirements are met. Test the **Visibility Toggle**.
*   **Onboarding**: Complete the biometric setup. Verify that **DOST-FNRI** targets are accurately calculated and persisted to the profile.
*   **Compliance**: Verify that the "Create Account" action is locked until the **Terms & Privacy** checkbox is engaged.
*   **Error Haptics**: intentionally mismatch passwords. Verify the device triggers a **"Heavy" vibration** alert.

## 🧠 2. AI Intelligence & Mathematical Accuracy
*   **Bespoke Planning (The 1358 kcal Test)**:
    *   Generate a **Daily Plan** for exactly **1358 kcal**.
    *   **Audit**: Sum the calories of the 3 meals. Verify the total is within +/- 50kcal of the target.
    *   **Split Check**: Verify the distribution follows the **25/35/40** clinical split (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner).
*   **NLP "Describe" (Magic Log)**:
    *   Input: *"I had two medium eggs and a bowl of garlic rice."*
    *   Verify the AI correctly identifies both items and pre-fills the logging screen with estimated weights and macros.
*   **Aisle Categorization**: 
    *   Add "Calamansi" to the shopping list. Verify it is automatically categorized under **"Produce"**.

## 📊 Dashboard, Analytics & Visuals
*   **Interactive Calendar Strip**:
    *   Log a meal for "Today." Verify the progress ring in the top calendar strip fills dynamically.
    *   Check future dates. Verify they display a **Dashed Border** (Pending state).
    *   Date travel: Tap a previous date. Verify the dashboard updates to show that day's specific intake.
*   **Liquid-Fluid Hydration**:
    *   Increment water. Verify the droplet fills with a smooth shader animation and the progress bar glides (not snaps).
*   **Surplus Detection**:
    *   Exceed your calorie goal. Verify the dashboard label switches to **"Calories over"** in Red with a **"+"** prefix.

## 👤 Profile & Technical Integrity
*   **App Version Verification**: Navigate to Profile. Scroll to the bottom and verify the **App Version** (e.g., 1.1.6+1) is visible and matches the official release.
*   **Functional Cleanup**: Verify that only active, functional settings are visible in the **Customizations** section (Theme, Surplus, Macro Presets, Sounds).
*   **Logout Lifecycle**: Sign out and sign back in. Verify all data (Saved recipes, meal logs, water) persists correctly from the local SQLite database.

## ⚡ Performance & Resilience
*   **Instant-Load Test**: Save 20+ recipes. Navigate to the "Saved" tab. Verify the list loads in **sub-200ms** without a spinner.
*   **Bulk Shopping Test**: Add a 7-day plan (21 meals) to the list. Verify the "Adding to List" state appears on the button and the process completes in **under 1 second**.
*   **Offline Discovery**: Enable Airplane Mode. Open the Recipes tab. Verify **"Featured Recipes from Local Library"** are displayed instead of an empty state.

## 🎨 Visual & Haptic Fidelity
*   **Universal Themes**: Switch between **Cream Light** and **Premium Dark**. Audit all modals (Describe, Add Ingredient) for high-contrast legibility.
*   **Liquid Glass Menu**: Open the Quick Add menu. Verify the **Frosted Glass** background blurs the underlying dashboard content at 60fps.
*   **Dismissal Logic**: Tap the blurred area outside the Quick Add menu. Verify it closes intuitively without needing a close button.
